# phpmaildirclass

## Description

phpmaildirclass is a small demo written in the scripting language PHP. It allows
you to view your mails in your favorite browser. Multiple mail folders and user
authentication by http (i.e. 'htpasswd') are supported.

Where the mail data come from does not matter as long as it is located in your
file system and is readable by the webserver/php process. It must be stored in
**Maildir** format easily recognisable by its folder names 'cur' and 'new' and
subfolders beginning with a dot. mbox (all mails in one file) is unsupported.

*It supports no mail sending by SMTP or any comfort like addressbook, HTML
formatting, PGP integration and so on. It is read-only and does NOT grab your
mails by POP3 or IMAP.*

## Requirements

* [PHP](http://www.php.net/). Versions less than 7.x are untested.

* A webserver. Either the PHP internal or another.

* A web browser capable of HTML5.

## Audience

Anyone interested in mail parsing or want to build a (read-only) webmail without
mail server access.

## Install

Well, copy all files to a directory your webserver can access.

You can adapt some variables in *pmdc-demo.php* to your needs to fit your
environment. Anything beyond the capabilities of this demo must be done on your
own.

*pmdc-class.php* does the dirty work by reading the contents of a given filename
and processes the header and body data. The raw is split into chunks and
computed one by one. "Meta data" like header lines, content type or charset
definitions are put directly on a stack where you can retrieve it. To save
compute time and memory body parts are not kept in memory but only byte offsets
where they can be found in the raw. Some resource limitations can be tweaked at
the beginning of the class.
